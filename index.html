<a id="what-is-daohub" class="anchor" href="#what-is-daohub" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Daohub?</h3>

<p>A crowd communication and governance platform designed from the ground up specifically for use by an emerging wave of DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations ).</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-is-a-dao" class="anchor" href="#what-is-a-dao" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is a DAO?</h3>

<p>DAOs are blockchain based collaborative structures that are ‘automated at the center, humans at the edges’, complete with their own internal capital to allocate as they desire. This internal capital is spent by accepting/declining proposals - immutable, binding contracts - by people, businesses, and organizations (known as service providers) who wish to transact with the DAO.</p>

<h3>
<a id="purpose-of-daohub" class="anchor" href="#purpose-of-daohub" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose of Daohub</h3>

<p>Daohub will provide a platform to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Establish and shape a DAOs social and cultural identity, ambitions, and purpose.
Facilitate discussion and debate about the general direction of the use of its internal capital.</li>
<li>Examine and comb through the details of a service provider’s proposal line by line, complete with annotations that host sub-discussions about the section in question.</li>
<li>Allow thought leaders or groups within a DAO to rise and accrue influence organically.
Reward meaningful contributions and disincentivize bad/wasteful ones.</li>
<li>Provide a mechanism for service providers to meet with and get feedback from the DAO prior to an official proposal - a virtual trade show of sorts. (Just thought about this, might be interesting).</li>
</ul>

<a id="daohub-governance" class="anchor" href="#daohub-governance" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Daohub Governance</h3>

<p>Daohub is an open-source organization.
Daohub will leverage a close relationship with the DAO, and build an initial product offering with the needs of the DAO in mind. 
In due time, daohub will submit a proposal to the DAO as a service provider to build the platform for its use. If accepted, the DAO will fund the development of daohub in return for preferential rates and a % of all future revenue. 
Daohub will then shop the platform around for use by other DAOs.</p>

<h3>
<a id="access-to-daohub" class="anchor" href="#access-to-daohub" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Access to Daohub</h3>

<p>A DAO’s daohub will only be accessible by using that DAO’s unique token as a key. Members of the general public with no ties to a DAO will be able to view its daohub, but not to participate.</p>

<a id="daohub-thread--comment-sorting" class="anchor" href="#daohub-thread--comment-sorting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Daohub Thread &amp; Comment Sorting</h3>

<p>Comments in a thread can be sorted by day/week/month and weighted by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stake</li>
<li>Web of trust/reputation</li>
<li>Upvote/downvotes</li>
<li>Number of replies</li>
<li>Controversy</li>
</ul>

<a id="paying-quality-posters-spam-control--discussion-fee-revenue" class="anchor" href="#paying-quality-posters-spam-control--discussion-fee-revenue" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Paying Quality Posters, Spam Control &amp; Discussion Fee Revenue</h3>

<p>Creating posts will cost the OP a small amount (1 - 5 cents), but will be enough to disincentivize spam posters. Replying to those threads will cost 1/10 of the OPs fee, creating child comments to these parent replies will cost even less, and upvoting/downvoting will be cheapest of all. The OP will receive the discussion fees from all of the main replies and thread upvotes, and commentators will receive discussion fees from their nested replies.</p>

<p>In this way, comment threads will double as a mechanism to redistribute fees amongst participants. Meaningful contributions will be rewarded financially, creating incentives for high quality discourse and thoughtful discussion. 
Daohub will take a percentage of all discussion fee revenue as a platform fee (YTBD, but something like 1%), which will be a main source of revenue. </p>

<h3>
<a id="daohub-moderation" class="anchor" href="#daohub-moderation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Daohub Moderation</h3>

<p>A daohub will most likely require community moderation. To mitigate the possibility of censorship or corruption, membership to the moderating team will be fluid. Members can vote mods in or out seamlessly. The exact method of voting is yet to be decided.</p>

<a id="daohub-censorship-resistance" class="anchor" href="#daohub-censorship-resistance" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Daohub Censorship Resistance</h3>

<ul>
<li>Redundant, decentralized storage of daohub using Storj/IPFS</li>
<li>DDOS protection</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="dao-splitting" class="anchor" href="#dao-splitting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DAO Splitting</h3>

<p>Daohubs will have to reflect their DAOs and be splittable, almost in real time. Large profile splits could be manually adjusted for, but it’s likely we’ll see smaller groups (&lt;12 people) splitting off from the parent DAO to form their own child DAOs and projects. If they have no holdings left in the parent DAO, they cannot be allowed to view it once the split is final. Users who hold tokens on both sides of a split will have access to both hubs.</p>

<p>
<p>Daohub should also recognize that a new group of tokens has been generated create a forum accordingly. This could get very complicated, very quickly. </p>

<p>100% open source. </p>
